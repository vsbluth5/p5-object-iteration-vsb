# Object Iteration Practice

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/upperlinecode/object-iteration-mini-lab-javascript)](https://repl.it/github/upperlinecode/object-iteration-mini-lab-javascript)

### The goal

In this lab, you'll start to deal with objects that organize data more and more clearly. We'll start with a list of favorite books, but each book is keyed to a person's name.

For example, to print Zara's favorite book, you'd use the code `console.log(favoriteBooks["zara"])`.

Open up iterate.js, code out solutions to the challenges, and run it to test your answers.
